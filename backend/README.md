<h1><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Udagram C4 Backend App</strong></span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything is configured and up &amp; running</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to implement the elasticsearch streaming from coudwatch but had problems and took it out again.</p>
<p>The application itself is working with the following features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The winston logger has a problem with merging the second parameter into the msg, so I implemented a wrappepr around it. Nothing fancy, but it works alright.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd appreciate any suggestions on how to improve this :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
